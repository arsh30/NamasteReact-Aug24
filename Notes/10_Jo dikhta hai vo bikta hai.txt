HOW TO STYLE OUR CODE: 

1st way of Writing css: 
    - we have index.css (all css in this file , easier way to do this, like a normal css)

2nd way we can use SaSS and ScSS:  (Not a recommend way, because company dont use this)

3rd way of writing css:
    - use Styled components library (We can use this)

4th way of writing css (Css library and framework, most companies use this): 
    - chakra ui, ant Design (mostly used), matiarial ui (mostly used), bootstrap,  (We get pre build component, and use in our component)
    - Tailwind css (we will use this, latest css framework , mostly developer use this nowadays)

Q) WHAT IS TAILWIND CSS? 
S) Tailwind css - it is utility first css framework, means we can make website without leaving HTML, 
    direct inline class denge , then it will apply


1. 1ST WAY TO CONFIGURE IN OUR REACT, (It works with all other ui framework, normal HTML)

    - go to tailwindcss.com 
    - In framework Guides -> choose Parcel (because our project used this)
        - npm install -D tailwindcss postcss [postcss, it is tool for transforming css with javascript]
        - npx tailwindcss init [this will create a configuration file for tailwind.config.js]

    - create a configuration file also for POST CSS: 
            - Create a '.postcssrc' At root Level. (because parcel need a postcssrc to understand the tailwind)
                    - {
                            "plugins": {
                                "tailwindcss": {}
                            }
                      }



    - Inside tailwind.config.js -> add this in content ie:
            -  content: [
                    "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // means all the files where tailwind we can use this
                    // means inside the src folder -> koi bhi folder ho -> jiski extension .html,.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx ho usme hm tailwind ki class use kr skte hai
                ],

    - In Index.css -> add the below lines: 
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
